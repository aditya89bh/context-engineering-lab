A research-practice repository investigating how intelligent systems decide
**what context to retain, compress, retrieve, prioritize, and forget**.

This is not another RAG implementation. The experiments themselves are the
product. Each one is built to answer a specific question and to produce a
result a careful reader can reproduce and argue with.

---

## The questions

- What information deserves to enter a limited context window?
- How much can context be compressed before task performance degrades?
- When does *forgetting* improve, rather than harm, downstream performance?
- How should the passage of time shape what gets retrieved?
- How should a fixed attention budget be allocated across competing items?
- How robust are these strategies when the input is adversarial?

A fuller statement of intent lives in the [repository thesis](docs/thesis.md),
the testable form in the [research questions](docs/research-questions.md), and the
boundaries in the [non-goals](docs/non-goals.md).

## How this repository is organized

This is a phased project. Phase 0 establishes the research design: shared
definitions, an experiment taxonomy, a benchmarking philosophy, a metrics
framework, and the engineering conventions that keep results reproducible.
Implementation phases follow the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## Status

**Phase 2 — Selection and Budgets.** Building on the Phase 1 harness, the lab now
runs its first controlled experiments on *selection under budget pressure*. It
ships six selection strategies (`first-n`, `last-n`, `recency`, `random`,
`keyword-overlap`, and an `oracle` ceiling), a synthetic
`selection-signal-retrieval` benchmark with three presets, four reproducible
experiments, and a Markdown report. Results are **early and benchmark-specific**:
they use controlled synthetic data, `oracle` is an upper bound (not deployable),
and nothing here is a general claim about context engineering. See the
[Phase 2 summary](docs/phase-2-summary.md) and
[selection benchmarks](docs/selection-benchmarks.md).

## Running the harness

```bash
context-lab list                                   # registered strategies/benchmarks
context-lab run-smoke --output artifacts/smoke-result.json
context-lab run-phase2 --output artifacts/phase2   # Phase 2 experiment suite + report
```

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

ruff check .       # lint
mypy               # strict type check
pytest             # tests
python -m build    # build sdist + wheel
```
